# assignment3RSA
1)Clone the project by using the command: git clone https://github.com/anushnaUppu/assignment3RSA.git

2)Go to the repository: cd assignment3RSA/

3)Compile the code using: gcc rsa.c

4)Execute the code : ./a.out

5)Enter a number(Ex: 3456)

6) The console will display all the information like the decrypted messages by two approches and time taken by them.

We can clearly see that the Decryption algorithm by using CRT approach will take less than the Naive approach.

Note: The Naive Approach will take sometime(around 20sec) inorder calculate the result as it is a time taking approach.
